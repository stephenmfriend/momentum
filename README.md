> [!WARNING]
> This tool is experimental and not ready for production use. 

The perfect companion to Flux. Because once the board starts moving, it shouldn’t stop.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Momentum, ensure you have:

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** - Anthropic's CLI for Claude
- **[Flux MCP](https://github.com/sirsjg/flux)** - Running and accessible (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to be installed.

```bash
brew tap stephenmfriend/momentum
brew install momentum
```

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> Currently only Claude Code is supported. Future releases will add support for other agents such as Codex.

### Agent Orchestration
- **Automatic task execution** - Watches for tasks and spawns Claude Code agents automatically
- **Async & sync modes** - Run multiple agents in parallel or sequentially (`--execution-mode`)
- **Graceful cancellation** - Stop agents cleanly with SIGINT handling

### Terminal UI
- **Multi-panel dashboard** - Monitor multiple running agents simultaneously
- **Real-time output streaming** - Watch agent progress with parsed JSON output
- **Keyboard navigation** - Tab between panels, scroll with j/k, stop/close agents
- **Auto-update notifications** - Get notified when new versions are available

### Flux Integration
- **Smart task selection** - Automatically picks unblocked todo tasks from auto-enabled epics
- **Flexible filtering** - Filter by `--project`, `--epic`, or `--task`
- **Real-time sync** - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant task updates
- **Workflow automation** - Automatic status transitions (todo → in_progress → done)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Watch all projects for tasks
momentum

# Watch a specific project
momentum --project myproject

# Watch a specific epic
momentum --epic epic-456

# Work on a specific task
momentum --task task-789
```

### Execution Modes

```bash
# Run agents in parallel (default)
momentum --project myproject --execution-mode async

# Run agents sequentially (one at a time)
momentum --project myproject --execution-mode sync
```

You can also toggle between modes at runtime by pressing `m` in the TUI.

### Custom Flux Server

```bash
# Connect to a different Flux server
momentum --base-url http://flux.example.com:3000 --project myproject
```

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Cycle focus between agent panels |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus backwards |
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down in focused panel |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up in focused panel |
| `m` | Toggle execution mode (async/sync) |
| `s` / `Esc` | Stop the focused agent |
| `x` / `c` | Close a finished panel |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |
